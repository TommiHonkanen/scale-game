# Scale Game

Scale game is a multiplayer game in which players compete against each other by stacking weights on top of scales and other weights. The game is turn-based and every player gets to place one weight each turn. 

Points are determined based on how far from the scale’s center the particular weight is. For example, a weight that is on a distance of three tiles from the center, grants the owner of that weight 3 points. Weights can also be stacked. If a player stacks a weight on top of other weights, that player is given the ownership of the weights that are below that weight and therefore also the points that those weights yield. 

If a weight is on the right side of a scale on a distance of 3 from the scale’s center, that weight also weighs down the right side by 3. The allowed imbalance before a scale tips over is equal to the scale’s radius. So for a scale with a radius of 5, the maximum allowed imbalance is 5.
