Interim report 16.3.2022

I have implemented working versions of all the classes that handle the functionality of the game (Scale, Weight, Game, Tile, Player) although there's likely going to be additional functionality added to these classes later. Error handling hasn't been implemented yet. Point and weight counting algorithms seem to be working fine. I wrote unit tests to test these and all the tests passed. I have spent the past couple of weeks trying to figure out how to implement the text UI but haven't been able to come up with anything that would work. It just seems so difficult to me since I would need to print each line of the game individually and know at all times every scale and weight that needs to be next to each other and somehow count the distance between parallel scales for example. I have been able to print individual scales but printing multiple scales has proven itself difficult. I have been thinking about making a GUI instead. I think the same kind of problems wouldn't exist if I were to make the interface with something like scalafx instead. So I think I'm going to stop trying to make the text based UI work and start trying to implement a graphical interface instead.  Hopefully that will be easier. So far I've spent something like 20 hours working on the project and I'm ahead of schedule but I think that's a good thing since making the interface is likely going to take more time than I had originally intended.
